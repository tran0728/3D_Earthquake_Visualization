Play at: https://csci-4611-spring-2022.github.io/assignment-3-tran0728/

Works with data from NASA and the USGS to visualize on a globe the locations where earthquakes happened between 1905 and 2007.

Visualizations incorporating geospatial data are used and analyzed in many different contexts, including navigating a city (as seen in GPS devices), commercial development, and setting governmental policy. Earthquake dataset used includes 13,540 different earthquakes.
